					<h2>Jekyll: an <b>easy</b> way to create creative websites, blogs... and presentations.</h2>
					<p>Jekyll runs on Ruby and, at it's basic definition, is a website generator. It can take a text template -- such as HTML or Markdown -- and returns a ready-to-publish static website capable of being hosted by whichever web server you desire.</p>
					<p>Notably, Jekyll is the engine on which Github pages runs!</p>
					<p>This presentation will go over the following information:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="/2015/12/07/brief-history-of-jekyll.html" >Brief History of Jekyll</a></li>
						<li><a href="/2015/12/06/setup-instructions.html">Setup Instructions</a></li>
						<li>Quick Start Instructions</li>
						<li>Updating Content</li>
						<li>Publishing to Github</li>
						<li>Miscellaneous Information</li>
						<li>My Conclusion</li>
					</ol>
					<p>The instructions are geared towards an entirely new user of Jeykll, with perhaps a novice level of knowledge about Github Pages, who is using a Unix-based system. My specific setup took place on Ubuntu 14.04. Jekyll <strong>can</strong> be run on a Windows machine, but apparantly the setup gets a little messy. Since I don't have a Windows machine anyway, I'll just leave that exploration for another day.</p>
					<p>Click on either one of the list items above, an item from the menu, or just continue scrolling below to explore this presentation. And Have Fun!</p>

								<p>Also, just in case it wasn't obvious, this website was generated using Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages (which you should know by now, since that's where you are). Jump to Publishing to GitHub Pages if you already know about Jeykll but want to learn more about how to get your site hosted for absolutely free using Github.</p>
