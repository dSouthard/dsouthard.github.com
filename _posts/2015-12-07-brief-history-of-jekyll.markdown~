Creation
====================

Jekyll was written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, who also co-founded GitHub. It was first released in 2008 and was/still is distributed under an open source license.

According to Jekyll's "README" file,

> It does what you tell it to do no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users 
> by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and 
> configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to 
> concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

Basically put, Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

### Important to Note!
Jekyll is **NOT** some sort of blogging software! It, by itself, does not come with any template designs or content. Jekyll is a **parsing engine**:
