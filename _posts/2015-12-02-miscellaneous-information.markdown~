What Other People Do
---------------------

Jekyll is relatively new, but it is massively popular especially for its purpose as a blogging site. It's easy to find many examples of how other people are using Jekyll to create dynamic and interesting websites. 

<a href = "https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites"> Here is a list of Jekyll-powered sites</a> for some idea of what exactly can be accomplished with this software.

Bootstrapping
---------------------

Another way of quickly creating a Jekyll website is by using a <a href = "https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=jekyll+bootstrap"> Jekyll bootstrap.</a> This creates a 100%-Github-compatible site with many customizable features, depending on whose bootstrap you use.

Some listed features are: 
\* Automatic syntax highlight
\* Multi-page
\* Automatic menu
\* Configurable additional links
\* Github counters

The main advantage of using a bootstrap is that the website it creates is much less bare-boned than using the quick-setup method described in this presentation.

I only came across bootstraps after I had started working on this presentation and haven't had any experience with using them, but in the future that would probably be the way I would go.
