It's Good!
---------------------

This presentation was by far the most fun for me to complete. The material I learned about was very interesting. Being able to create such a well-organized and visually interesting website capable of being easily loaded up with new content was just great. 

Jekyll is easy to learn. It requires a lot of previous knowledge -- Markdown, HTML, CSS, etc. -- but none of those are in themselves difficult. There are many parts of how exactly Jekyll parses the provided content that I'm not too well-versed on, and this presentation only very lightly touched on that subject. But for anyone who uses a blog, using Jekyll would be an easy and probably useful investment.

The most frustrating part was getting the initial setup completed, since my first instint was to go with the default package manager. It was only after that failed that I realized the necessary steps for an up-to-date Ruby installation. 

It's Useful!
---------------------

The fact that Jekyll is so well-integrated with Github serves as a very useful tool for developers. On the <a href = "http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll site</a>, they note that their software is stored on their Github repo's main branch while their descriptive website is stored on the gh-pages branch. It's an effective way to both share the necessary code for developers and create a beautiful website for users.

In the future, I will probably emulate their example. I've done other Android projects where the work was shared between team partners and where we had to create presentations about the project. It would have been savvy of us to use the same site space to work on those separate parts.

It's Over!
---------------------

I hope that the developer unfamiliar with Jekyll will have found this presentation worthwhile and will have developed the urge to try out this language themselves. Remember, it's a website up and running, in 3 minutes or less!
